                    You can find many notes from the mythological and legendary documents about the Brahmagiri hills. The special story says that sage Gautam used to cultivate in his paddy field for the purpose of feeding some Rishis in his Ashram. One day, he saw a cow grazing his paddy field and the cow was killed with a dharbha by Saint Gautam while trying to ward it off.
                    He felt very bad after this incident and sought the guidance from the Rishis to wash out this sin. The rishis advised him to approach Lord Shiva to release Ganges to wash out all the sins. To wash the sins, he has practiced penance by going to the peak of Brahmagiri to worship Lord Shiva to bring river Ganga from heaven.

                    Pleased with Sage Gautam’s worships, Lord Shiva requested Ganga to flow down in the form of Godavari River to wash out the sins of Sage Gautam. Initially, Ganga was not ready to pour off to earth after Lord Shiva’s request. Ganga was convinced only after Lord Shiva has made a Tandav dance on the peak of Brahmagiri hills. Finally the sin of killing a cow by Sage Gautam was wiped off in Godavari River. Hence, the Godavari River is also known as River Gautami.

                    The Brahmagiri hill is believed to be the form of Lord Shiva, hence climbing the mountain was considered as the solution for sins. For the purpose of ease access to Brahmagiri hills, Seth Lalchand Jashodanand Bhambhani of Karachi and Seth Ganeshdas constructed 500 stone steps in the year of 1908. You can see the Shiva and Godavari temples at the top of Brahmagiri hills. There is a huge Audumber tree can be spotted at the base of Brahmagiri hills. Sadyo-Jata, Vamdev, Tat-Purusha, Aghora and Ishana are the five peaks of Brahmagiri hills, which are considered as five mouths of the Lord Shiva.
                    The temple hosts several festivals throughout the year, attracting large crowds and creating a vibrant atmosphere. These events showcase the rich cultural traditions of the region, allowing visitors to immerse themselves in local customs and celebrations.
